## UEFI boot
to install macos on chromebox, we need to do some hw and firmware changes first to enable UEFI boot.
### Remove write-protect screw
https://kodi.wiki/view/Chromebox#Disable_Firmware_Write_Protect

### Install custome firmware
https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript

Install Custom coreboot Firmware (Full ROM). During the installation you should save a backup of the original firmware, in case you want to run chromeOS again.

## Install MAC OS

## Post Installation

### Ethernet
Use driver RealtekRTL8111-V2.3.0d7.kext

thanks mieze to provide this fix to workaround the empty MAC address issue
>"In the driver's Info.plist I added the option "fallbackMAC" to "Driver Parameters". "fallbackMAC" is a string which may be used to supply your original MAC address. It is used only if retrieving a valid MAC address fails. In the default configuration, the string is empty. In case you need it, please fill in your MAC with the following syntax "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" in which every x represents exactly one hexadecimal digit."  https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/287161-new-driver-for-realtek-rtl8111/?page=56&tab=comments#comment-2686166

### Display
To use the acerlerated driver for Intel HD4400, the only key to be modified in config.plist is Graphics->ig-platform-id = 0x0d220003

Default working settings for intel gpu (IGPU@2) are as following. check those value with IORegistryExplorer, if the display doesn't work correctly.

| key    | Property             | Value       |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| igpu@2 | AAPL,ig-platform-id  | 0300220d    |
| igpu@2 | device-id            | 12040000    |
| igpu@2 | hda-gfx              | "onboard-1" |
| AppleIntelFramebuffer@0 | connector-type | 00080000 |

### Audio
HDMI Audio works with VoodooHDA 2.9.2 kext. Only surround sound playing has strange issue, the central channel (mainly speech) is very blurry and quiet. 

Onboard Realtek ALC283 is not shown as audio device. Still working on that.

### Wifi/Bluetooth
the AR9462 doesn't work, no wifi device is identified. The ATH9KFixup doesn't help in Mojave and Catalina.
Bluetooth driver is loaded, but no bluetooth device can be found.

ToDo: buy wifi card
